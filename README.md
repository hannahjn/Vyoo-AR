# Vyoo - Augmented Reality 

Part of Lighthouse Labs MTL final project submission.

Designed to complement the vyoÍžo e-commerce site - https://github.com/hannahjn/vyoo

This repository renders a fully moveable basic 3D model of a chair in AR, along with a product description.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
3. `npm install` to install dependencies
4. `npm run serve` to launch server
5. Navigate to localhost:1337

### Notes

Designed to be used with the Argon browser.
This code works best on a mobile browser; it does not access the webcam on a computer. Therefore, it renders a blank screen behind the 3D object which is replaced by the camera output when using Argon.
